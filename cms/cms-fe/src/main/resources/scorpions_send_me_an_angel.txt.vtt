00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.600
The wise man said just walk this way          

1
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.200
To the dawn of the light

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.700
The wind will blow into your face

As the years pass you by

In the eye of the storm          

12
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.000
Seek the roses along the way          

13
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.500
Just beware of the thorns

Find the door to the promised land
